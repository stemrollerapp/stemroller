# StemRoller

StemRoller is the first free app which enables you to separate vocal and instrumental stems from any song with a single click! StemRoller uses Facebook's state-of-the-art [Demucs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs) algorithm for demixing songs and integrates search results from YouTube.

Simply type the name/artist of any song into the search bar and click the **Split** button that appears in the results! You'll need to wait several minutes for splitting to complete. Once stems have been extracted, you'll see an **Open** button next to the song - click that to access your stems!

## Quick Start

Using StemRoller couldn't be easier - just head to the [StemRoller website](https://stemroller.com) or the [releases page](https://github.com/stemrollerapp/stemroller/releases) and download the latest version! That bundle includes everything you need to split stems. If, however, you want to get involved in StemRoller development, read on...
